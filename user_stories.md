As the owner of Busmall, I want to produce an engaging and effective catalog, so that we can save money on printing and on inventory.

As a designer, I want to know what types of images the customers are looking for, so we can provide a better customer experience. 

As a bus rider, I want a catalog that is easy to browse, so it'll be easier for me to understand the products and make a purchase.

As a bus driver, I want a catalog that is durable, so it won't fall apart and make a mess on the bus.
